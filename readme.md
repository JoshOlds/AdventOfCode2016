# Advent Of Code 2016 Challenges -

Included here are my solutions to the Advent of Code 2016 Challenges. I chose to approach each problem with C#, as I wanted to reinforce my knowledge of the language, and implement SOLID principles as best I could.

To run any of my solutions, you can clone the repository, and execute 'dotnet run' in your command shell. The default solution to run is Day1.cs

To change the solution being ran, you can edit the Program.cs file.
